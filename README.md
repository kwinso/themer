# Themer [IN DEVELOPMENT]
A tool that allows you to update your desktop theme with just one command.


## What Themer can do?
- [X] Automatically set/swap color scheme variables (practically any variables) defined in your configuration file
- [X] Custom format: define your own code to be injected when you swap a theme.
- [X] Ignoring variables you don't need for each file
- [ ] Aliasing colors for some custom names 
- [ ] `<import:path/to/file>` statement for importing files into user-defined code
