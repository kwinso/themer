# Change colors inside i3 config
Assuming you have read project's Wiki, the most obvious thing to do is to define Themer block inside your i3's config.  
Find a place where colors are defined, and wrap it with comments that themer will recognize, and you should get something like this:
```
# i3 config goes here...

# THEMER
set $background #1a1b26
set $background_alt #565f89
set $foreground #c0caf5
set $foreground_alt #f7768e
# THEMER_END

# i3 config continues here...
```
Don't think about these variables inside the block, it's fine to leave just 2 lines of comments: `# THEMER` and `# THEMER_END`

# Themer config
Now we need to register i3 config inside Themer's config. By default it's located in `~/.config/themer/config.yml` 
If you haven't already, define some themes:
```yaml
themes:
  # Just a dummy themes, put any variables you want, not only colors!
  dark: 
    background: #000000
    foreground: #ffffff
  light: 
    background: #ffffff    
    foreground: #000000
```

Then, define an i3 config file:
```yaml
files:
  i3:
    # Themer can expand tildes!
    path: "~/.config/i3/config"
    comment: "#" # you can skip this one, because hash (#) is the default comment for Themer
    format: "set $<key> <value>"
```

# Bonus
You can set reload command to automatically update your i3 environment after you set a theme:
```yaml
# Put any command that can be executed via shell
reload: "i3 reload"

themes:
  # ...
files:
  # ...
```

# Testing
You're good to go with this. You can check how themer recognizes your file by running this command:
```bash
$ themer files --check
> Listed configuration files:
> 
> ok i3 (~/.config/i3/config)
```

# Setting a theme
To set a theme, run this command: 
```bash
$ themer set <theme name>
```
